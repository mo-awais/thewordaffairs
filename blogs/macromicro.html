                        <p>Without goals, it is hard to visualise a future where all the details can be worked out. Dreams are one thing – the rose-tinted view we have of our futures, the plans we make for the years ahead. But goals – it is all about putting those dreams into perspective.<br></p>
                        <p>Personally, I always struggled with working everyday with the thought of achieving what I want for the long run. During my sixth form years, I had a love-hate relationship with A-Levels and looking back now, I would put it down to not being able to fully visualise the end goal. Or rather, as I now see it, the macro goal. That, and the burn-out that was never identified at the time, but that’s a story for another day.<br></p>
                        <p>I actually came across this way of defining goals through Anas Nuur Ali’s videos on Youtube. In one of them, he spoke about how to identify the macro goal you have. An example is the degree you may be working towards and the end goal would be the class of degree you want and graduation. So how can<br>you get there? How are you going to identify what needs to be done everyday so that one day, you can stand there in a black gown and cap at your graduation? Well, you need to set yourself targets every day, ways for you to be consistent in working towards getting your degree – the micro goals. And these will take form in completing your assignments (ideally on time!), putting in the hours to go<br>over your lecture notes and actually attending lectures!<br></p>
                        <p>My personal take on this is that it needs to be consistent. For anything to work in life and to make<br>it into a habit, you need to be consistent. So, if you plan ahead, you’ll get further ahead, my friend. Of course, there are people out there who pull all-nighters closer to the time and lo and behold, their assignment is completed twenty minutes before the deadline and eventually, they’ll also get a high grade on it too. But if you are not that type of person, then do not worry – in fact, join the club! I have never been the type to really do things last minute, I like to keep it organised and see what I have got lined up for the week, and that includes my studying too. And everyone is different, so I know that for me, I have to start months before to prepare for exams. And a little a day goes a long way. But consistency is what is needed.<br></p>
                        <p>You see, I have noticed that by using this formula, I have been able to see exactly how the little things in my everyday life add up to create the bigger picture. And so, I like to keep track of that. I do that through my journaling, making my to-do lists, my timetables and even writing down the things I need to do on my calendar app. All of this adds up to the macro goal that I want to achieve, whatever that may be.<br></p>
                        <p>At the end of the day, they are still goals, they are still tasks you need to check off your to-do lists. But it’s just about putting it all into perspective. If you define what you need to do, you’ll find it easier to tackle it because it has been made clearer and put into focus. So do your future self a favour and start defining your goals – put your dreams into perspective.<br></p>
