                        <p>So, if you are in the mood for a really good cry and want to watch a movie that will wrench out your heartstrings, watch <em>Five Feet Apart</em>. Without giving too much away, girl meets boy and love is in the air. But how do you love someone that could essentially end your life? How do you love someone with cystic fibrosis when you suffer from the same condition?<br></p>
                        <p>Let’s just say, I was a complete mess when the film ended. I couldn’t stop crying and not just because of the plot of the movie but because it made me realise just how short life is. I mean, it didn’t take a good Netflix session to make me realise that, I’m pretty sure if we have re-learned anything this year it’s that life indeed is very, very short and you only have one shot at it. But this film! I mean, it was just so beautiful.<br></p>
                        <p>As most of the film is set in a hospital and focuses on the characters’ medical journeys and the fight for life, it highlighted just how amazing doctors, nurses, and the revolution of healthcare really is. To see how far they are willing to go to save someone’s life is just breath-taking, the sacrifices that have to be made and essentially, strike at any opportunity. Because when you are saving lives, you can’t wait around. You have to think on the spot and make decisions that will essentially affect everyone in that room.<br></p>
                        <p>And what really struck me is that yes, at the end of the day, this is just a film. But those<br>situations? Those moments of life and death? They’re all real. They exist everywhere, all over the world and they happen every day. Right now, as I am writing this and when you’re going to be reading this, someone out there is fighting for their life. Someone out there is having to mix in their medication<br>with their yoghurts and chocolate desserts like Stella had to in Five Feet Apart because that is their life. And they are having to live with it. And those doctors and nurses that check up on them around the clock? They do that every day with so many people because that is what they have committed themselves to.<br><br>If anything, the Qur’an describes it perfectly:<br></p>
                        <figure>
                            <figcaption>Every soul shall taste death. (Surat-al Imran, 3:185)<br></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>We’re all going to die one day. In reality, it may sound a little pessimistic but how can you deny the truth? The truth is that we are all going to return back to the Creator one day. We just have to prepare for that. But we also have to remember how Allah has told us to live our lives:<br></p>
                        <figure>
                            <figcaption>And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin<br>and aggression. (Surat-al Ma’idah, 5:2)<br></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Righteousness. Piety. Imagine, just imagine if you were provided with the chance to save someone’s life. You could change someone’s life and stop their pain. How high would that rank on the level of righteousness? And above all, how would you make that person feel? And to think, the saviours in hospitals do that every day. They change and save lives. It’s just what they do.<br></p>
